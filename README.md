# LSB-Stenography


Stenography ?
A practice of concealing a file, message, image, 
or video within another file, message, image, or video.


Why?
● Hide secret credentials
● Detect data forgery
● Message Passing.


Where?
● Military 
● Intelligence agencies
● On line elections
● Internet banking
● Medical-imaging and so on

How?
● Physical 
● Prints and paints
● Puzzles
● Digital


Digital
● Though there are different possible methods available, 
we would go with digital steganography
● In digital method the message is concealed within the 
lowest bits of images or sound files
● The current project expects us to implement LSB (Least 
Significant Bit) Image Steganography on a .bmp file

An Image - Pixel
● A pixel is the smallest individual element, holding 
antiquated values that represent the brightness of a 
given color at any specific point.
● A pixel also can be said as a smallest addressable 
element in an all points addressable display device; so 
it is the smallest controllable element of a picture 
represented on the screen.
● Each pixel is a sample of an original image; more 
samples typically provide more accurate 
representations of the original


An Image - Pixel
● The intensity of each pixel is variable.
● In color imaging systems, a color is typically 
represented by three or four component intensities such 
as red, green, and blue (RGB), or cyan, magenta, 
yellow, and black (CMYK)



An Image - Format
● Image file formats are standardized means of organizing 
and storing digital images
● Image files are composed of digital data in one of these 
formats that can be rasterized for use on a computer 
display or printer. 
● An image file format may store data in uncompressed, 
compressed, or vector formats.
● Once rasterized, an image becomes a grid of pixels, 
each of which has a number of bits to designate its 
color equal to the color depth of the device displaying 
it.

An Image – Format - BMP
● The BMP file format (Windows bitmap) handles graphic 
files within the Microsoft Windows OS. 
● Typically, BMP files are uncompressed, and therefore 
large and lossless; their advantage is their simple 
structure and wide acceptance in Windows program
